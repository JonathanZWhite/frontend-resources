##Javascript Frameworks
###[Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
AngularJS is an open-source web application framework, maintained by Google and community, that assists with creating single-page applications, one-page web applications that only require HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client side. Its goal is to augment web applications with model–view–controller (MVC) capability, in an effort to make both development and testing easier.

##[D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
D3.js (or just D3 for Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library that uses digital data to drive the creation and control of dynamic and interactive graphical forms which run in web browsers. It is a tool for data visualization in W3C-compliant computing, making use of the widely implemented Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), JavaScript, HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3) standards.

###Tutorials
- [Making bar charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/)

##[Node](http://nodejs.org/)/[Express](http://expressjs.com/)
Node.js is a runtime environment and a library for running applications written in JavaScript outside the browser (for example, on the server). Node.js applications are designed to maximize throughput and efficiency, using non-blocking I/O and asynchronous events. Node.js applications run single-threaded, although Node.js uses multiple threads for file and network events. Node.js is commonly used for real time applications due to its asynchronous nature, allowing applications to display information faster for users without the need for refreshing.
